# Electronics Inventory Management System

## License
This project is open-source and licensed under the MIT License.

## Introduction
The Electronics Inventory Management System is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It is designed to efficiently manage the inventory of electronic products, providing a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting products, tracking stock levels, and monitoring sales analytics.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Product Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for products.
- **Real-time Stock Updates**: Automatically adjust inventory levels when products are sold or restocked.
- **Sales Dashboard**: Visualize sales data and track trends over time.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across a range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
